Scripts for training models to predict DEGs vs nonDEGs using CNN models.
The analysis is based on Washburn et al. 2019. Previous steps are analyzed using the scripts by Emily Bellis, https://github.com/em-bellis/CNN_GxE

*getLabels.py
The script transforms a list of up regulated, down regulated and non DEGs to the binary format required for reading into the testHyperparametersDEGvsnonDEG.py scripts as Labels.

*testHyperparametersDEGvsnonDEG.py
Using a list of desired hyperparameter values the training and testing of grid search for each model is performed.

*random_forest.R

Script used to do random forest analysis for Col-0 DEGs.
